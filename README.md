## Overview
This is a basic airplane game prototype created in Unity. The game features a small aircraft that the player can control to navigate through an environment with obstacles. The primary focus is on demonstrating simple airplane movement mechanics and propeller rotation effects.

## Features
1. **Airplane Movement**:
   - The player controls a small airplane to navigate through the environment.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - The game environment includes obstacles to test navigation skills.
3. **Rotating Propeller**:
   - The airplane's front propeller rotates dynamically using the `Rotation` script for a visual effect.

## How to Play
1. **Launch the Game**:
   - Extract the `.exe` file from the provided `winrar` archive and run it to start the game.
2. **Player Controls**:
   - Use the default movement controls to maneuver the airplane through the environment. (Note: Specific key bindings may not be included due to the absence of the original scripts.)
3. **Objective**:

## Notes
- This is a **prototype** and is not a full-fledged game.
- The project focuses on basic mechanics, including movement and obstacle interactions.
- Only the executable file is provided, so further development will require recreating or rewriting missing scripts.
